# To Do

- [x] Nuke lots of recent work, priorities too, by rewriting to be CUSTOM-COMPONENT-BASED
- [x] Wrappers or custom only
- [x] Basic custom Geometry Nodes
  - [x] Box
- [x] Add-new button for adding another generic box
  - [x] stubbed button
  - [x] Make it -add another GenericBox. Just that for now. Keep-it-simple-for-now
  - [x] click shape to selct
- [x] Fix exporting again
  - [x] Generate component-tree works
  - [x] Needs exported-components import(s) generated, in ExportedTree
  - [x] Need exported tree to go into a file `exported/src/components/ExportedTree.tsx`
  - [x] need to put component files into like, `exported/src/components/GenericBox.tsx`
  - [x] generate file previews, display previews, functiion exports
- [x] Fix Rotation issue(s) for GenericBox
  - [x] stop resetting on try-again
    - [x] be able to compine diff axis rotations
  - [x] Remove whole numbers. Decimals of >1 are all that's needed?
- [x] Add component-picker
- [x] Add a `Plane` component type
  - [x] Plane-component works from basic-starter-template
    - [x] half way there, need to make hooks or something for controls and Gizmos
      - [x] Need to select-on-click
  - [x] update `handleAddNode`/`useAddNewNode` to be dynamic
  - [x] add saving-changes for template-json
  - [ ] add revert template-json to a generic, new starter-template
  - [ ] add template-json switching, between projects, basis for levels
- [ ] Add a `Lighting` component
  - [x] Add directionalLight component.
  - [ ] Add pointLight?
  - [ ] Add ambientLight?
  - [ ] HemishphereLight?
  - [ ] Add global editor-settings, Add one for like, `show_ambient_light`, add the global toggle to each light-component side-bar
- [x] Add optional rotation to position-hook. Test in Generic Cube
- [x] Add Slope/ramp/"3D Triangle"/prism
- [ ] Add a `Character-Controller` component type..
  - [x] bug?/need-improvement, camera positions are relative to world, not local to character/rigid-body ... so original camera pos needs to be zero-based. no good
  - [x] tests with 3rd-person camera
  - [ ] First-person, no-thing clone style
    - [x] NEXT ...> add `fixed` option to shape opject-types
    - [x] Permenant, template saving...
    - [ ] Test/make - Programatic rotation, with rotation disabled
    - [ ] BUG - sometimes, right after selecting another shape, if you touch the new shapes gizmo, it performs operations on the previous one. Like, 2 gizoms are there, or 2nd item stuff gets applied to first...
      - [ ] NOT easily reproduced. Skip for now
      - [ ] ^^ Just try adding a small timeout-callback for setting a new selection. Might be saving to the wrong one after selectedNode changes quickly. OR, just wait until any pending changes are saved before allowing new selection to happen... Like, in zustand, save a Next_Selected, and make the change after the update is completed -if any next-selected
    - [ ] BUG - Position clicking the numbers/arrow-buttons don't update it properly anymore.
    - [ ] BUG - ^ similar but for rotation. not quite right when updated with numbers/arrows
    - [ ] NI - Maybe gizmo should het bigger when you zoom out.
    - [ ] NI - Adjusted item should maybe be followed by the camera?
    - [x] add floating platforms.. what else is needed?
    - [ ] BUG - clicking on an eisting box, causes an update, tecnically.. Because `fixed:undefined` gets changed to `fixed:false`
