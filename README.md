# React Three Fiber (r3f) Builder

The goal of this project is to build a visual editor for building scenes for React Three Fiber. You can add ThreeJs primitives provided by r3f, or custom components loaded. Add them to your scene and configure their props with a GUI. 

You can see changes previewed in real-time. When you're ready, you can export your scene to valid r3f code and into a react project to run your scene as you've made it.

One day, I'd like it to be more of a Unity-like experience for R3F and the web.
