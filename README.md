# React Three Fiber (r3f) Creator

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6831540/187117761-6fb9f5e8-9ee3-46f8-90c9-a08db291f6ef.jpeg)

The goal of this project is to create a visual editor for building scenes for React Three Fiber. You can add ThreeJs primitives provided by r3f, or custom components loaded into the editor. Add them to your scene and configure their props with a GUI.

You can see changes previewed in real-time within the editor. When you're ready, you can export your scene to valid r3f code and into a react project. Run your scene as you've made it.

Ideally I'd like it to be more of a Unity-like experience for R3F and the web.

Always free and open source 😀
