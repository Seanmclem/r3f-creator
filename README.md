# React Three Fiber (r3f) Game Creator

The goal of this project is to create a visual editor for building scenes for React Three Fiber. You can add custom components loaded into the editor. Add them to your scene and configure their props with a GUI.

You can see changes previewed in real-time within the editor. When you're ready, you can export your scene to valid r3f code and into a react project. Run your scene as you've made it.

Ideally I'd like it to be more of a Unity-like experience for R3F and the web.

Always free and open source ðŸ˜€
